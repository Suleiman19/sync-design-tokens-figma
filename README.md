# Sync Design Tokens

Automatically create and update Figma Styles from a design tokens url.

Import Style Dictionary (json) design tokens into your Figma so you don't have to manually create or update styles.

## How it works
- Enter the URL for your json design tokens file
- Choose the variable formatting style (optional)
- Click 'Import Tokens' button

## What's supported
Creates & updates color design tokens from a URL. In the future, I hope to expand support to other token types like font, grids, spacing, etc.
